SUDS-MAGELLAN
-------------

This project's goal is to provide a slightly more comprehensive and readable webservice map that the default
print method for the webservice client that comes with SUDS.

Requirement:
* You need suds [1] installed in all cases (obviously): sudo easy_install suds
* In the current state of the code you also need to have python-ntlm [2] installed: unfortunately this is not yet
available in pypi, so the best you can do is:

  svn co http://python-ntlm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ python-ntlm-read-only
  cd python-ntlm-read-only
  sudo python setup.py install
